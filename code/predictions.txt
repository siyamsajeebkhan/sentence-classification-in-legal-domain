States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (hereinafter, 
"the Court") held, in part, that a VCAA notice, as required 
by 38 U.S.C.A. § 5103(a), must be provided to a claimant 
before the initial unfavorable decision on a claim for VA 
benefits by the agency of original jurisdiction (in this 
case, the RO). -----> LegalRule
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Court also held, however, that providing

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this case, in letters dated in September 2002, January 
2003, and October 2003, the RO provided notice to the veteran 
regarding what information and evidence is needed to 
substantiate the claim for service connection, as well as 
what information and evidence must be submitted by the 
veteran, what information and evidence will be obtained by 
VA, and the need for the veteran to advise VA of or submit 
any further evidence that pertains to the claim. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The veteran and his representative were also provided with a 
copy of the appealed rating decision, as well as an August 
2004 Statement of the Case (SOC). -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These documents provided 
them with notice of the law and governing regulations, as 
well as the reasons for the determinations made regarding his 
claim. -----> EvidenceBasedOrIntermediateFinding
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By way of these documents, they also were 
specifically informed of the cumulative evidence already 
having been previously provided to VA or obtained by VA on 
the veteran's behalf. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Additionally, the SOC included a 
summary of the relevant VCAA regulatory provisions of 
38 C.F.R. § 3.159. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Therefore, the Board finds that the 
veteran was notified and aware of the evidence needed to 
substantiate this claim, the avenues through which he might 
obtain such evidence, and the allocation of responsibilities 
between himself and VA in obtaining such evidence. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Accordingly, there is no further duty to notify, and no 
prejudice to the veteran exists by deciding the claim. -----> EvidenceBasedOrIntermediateFinding
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The record also reflects that VA has made reasonable efforts 
to obtain relevant records adequately identified by the 
veteran. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Specifically, the information and evidence that 
have been associated with the claims file includes the 
veteran's service medical records, service personnel records, 
and post-service medical records and examination reports. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Under the circumstances in this case, the veteran has 
received the notice and assistance contemplated by law and 
adjudication of the claim poses no risk of prejudice to the 
veteran. -----> EvidenceBasedOrIntermediateFinding

The Board has reviewed all the evidence in the appellant's 
claims file, which includes:  his contentions, including 
those raised at June 2004 and October 2005 VA hearings; 
service medical and personnel records; VA medical records; 
medical records from a Vet Center; a private psychological 
evaluation; information from Fort Belvoir; and information 
from the National Personnel Records Center. -----> Evidence

The veteran contends that he has PTSD due to a personal 
assault which occurred approximately between January and -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
March 1970 while he was stationed at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He asserts that the incident involved both sexual and 
physical assault, and that he does not know the name of the 
perpetrator, who was a cook at Fort Belvoir. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By a January 
2003 written statement and in subsequent testimony, he said 
that during the attack, he was very drunk, and the 
perpetrator punched him in the mouth, and a tooth was 
loosened, cracked, or broken as a result. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He said that he 
was later found by a soldier on guard duty, and was taken by 
military police to receive medical treatment. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He later 
received counseling from a mental health professional, whom 
he only told about the physical aspects of the assault. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 
doctor told him he would try to obtain a general discharge 
for the veteran, but this did not occur. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After this 
incident, he went to his electronics school, and despite 
failing this course, he was posted to Germany, where he 
remained for the remainder of his active duty service. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He 
stated that he began to drink heavily after this incident. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He said that the first time he ever told anyone about the 
sexual aspect of the assault was at his November 2002 VA 
examination. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A review of the veteran's service medical records reflects 
that in early January 1970, the veteran was brought to the 
emergency room at DeWitt Army Hospital at Fort Belvoir by 
military police, who reported that the veteran was 
threatening to kill somebody, and did not want to be around 
the people in his barracks because he did not like them. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He 
denied drinking and using drugs. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This treatment note does 
not identify any trauma. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The examiner prescribed Valium. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The report noted that the veteran would be seen in the mental 
hygiene clinic in the morning. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are no records of such 
follow-up treatment. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On separation medical examination in 
January 1972, the veteran's psychiatric system was listed as 
normal. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The service medical records are entirely negative 
for psychiatric treatment, and are negative for a diagnosis 
of a psychiatric disorder. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Service medical records are also 
negative for treatment of facial injuries or dental trauma, 
and are negative for treatment of an assault. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Service personnel records do not include any reports from the 
military police about the alleged incident. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The veteran's 
records show that he received promotions to E-3 in June 1970, 
and to E-4 in September 1970, and that he received a letter 
of appreciation in December 1971 for his "outstanding and 
conscientious ability to be a soldier...." -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Multiple attempts 
to obtain additional service and personnel records have been 
unsuccessful. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At a November 2002 VA psychiatric examination, the examiner 
noted that she had reviewed the veteran's claims file and 
service medical records. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Other than seeing a psychiatrist in 
service two or three times, the veteran said he had never 
received any outpatient or inpatient care for mental health 
reasons. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
She summarized the veteran's description of the 
alleged in-service assault. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The veteran asserted that he had 
become an alcoholic because of this event. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He reported a 
significant alcohol history, and said he began to drink very 
heavily after separation from service. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Axis I diagnosis 
was alcoholism. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The examiner indicated that the veteran did 
not display the signs and symptoms of someone suffering from 
PTSD because his sleep was not impaired, he had very little 
problems with panic, and he denied flashbacks, nightmares or 
intrusive thoughts. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
She said that the veteran did not 
display symptoms of a mental disorder other than substance 
abuse, and this was unlikely to be due to the single event in 
service. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VA medical records from a Vet Center dated from 2003 to 2004 
reflect that the veteran was diagnosed with PTSD due to 
military sexual trauma. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In February 2003, a counseling 
therapist noted that the veteran's developmental history 
included no information which would provide an alternative 
diagnosis or an etiology other than the military sexual 
trauma he reportedly experienced in service. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A June 2003 private psychological evaluation from W. Paul, 
Ph.D., reflects that the veteran was diagnosed with PTSD and 
rule out alcohol abuse. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. Paul summarized the veteran's 
reported history of sexual abuse in service, and noted that 
the veteran complained of symptoms including insomnia, 
exaggerated startle reactions, and flashbacks. -----> Evidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The medical evidence reflects a difference of opinion as to 
whether the veteran currently has PTSD. -----> EvidenceBasedReasoning
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
However, even 
assuming that there is a valid diagnosis of PTSD under the 
criteria of DSM-IV, service connection for PTSD also requires 
credible evidence of an in-service stressor. -----> EvidenceBasedOrIntermediateFinding

The Board is unable to find 
that the veteran's alleged service stressor has been verified 
by official service records or other credible supporting 
evidence. -----> EvidenceBasedReasoning
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The weight of the credible evidence establishes that a 
stressor which might lead to PTSD did not occur in service. -----> EvidenceBasedReasoning

Thus, regardless of diagnosis, service connection for PTSD 
may not be granted. -----> EvidenceBasedOrIntermediateFinding

The veteran may apply to reopen his 
claim in the future, by submitting independent evidence to 
corroborate a service stressor, or by submitting sufficiently 
detailed information as would permit the VA to attempt 
stressor verification through the service department. -----> EvidenceBasedReasoning
